Topic #1: Loan Grade Prediction/Modeling

Based on loan amount, interest rate, and other factors provided by the data, can we predict what the loan grade will be?
Possible techniques include:
- Linear (logistic?) regression
- LASSO/ElasticNet or forward/backward/stepwise regression for model selection
- maybe PCA or some other dimension-reducing technique

Topic #2: Grade Classification

I didn't look too deep into this, but a cursory glance online indicates that the specific way in which loans are graded is kept
somewhat a secret. Could we perhaps use classification techniques to try to determine how loans are graded?
Classification techniques that might be useful:
- Linear classifiers
- K-nearest neighbors (KNN) or K-means/medoids clustering
- Decision trees
- Support vector machines (SVM's) but honestly we probably won't need these

Of course, we could always fall back on...

Topic #3: Exploratory Data Analysis or an EDA-Related Topic

What patterns exist in the data? Can we come up with a specific hypothesis from data exploration and run tests to find evidence for it?
Topics will depend on what the hypothesis is. I mainly suggest this because in addition to loan.csv, the database.sqlite file contains
SIGNIFICANTLY more information to sift through. This might be stuff we want to run the more advanced models on if possible, or some
reductive technique like PCA.
